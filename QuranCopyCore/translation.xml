	<row AyahId="63" Translation="Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that you might be grateful."/>
	<row AyahId="64" Translation="Then We caused the clouds to provide shade for you and sent down for you manna and quails, saying, &quot;Eat the good things We have provided for you.&quot; Indeed, they did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves."/>

	<row AyahId="83" Translation="When they meet the faithful, they say, &quot;We are believers.&quot; But when alone, they say to each other, &quot;Must you tell them what God has revealed to us? They will only use it to argue against you before your Lord! Have you no sense?&quot;"/>
	<row AyahId="84" Translation="Do they not know that God knows all that they conceal and all that they disclose?"/>
	<row AyahId="85" Translation="There are among them unlettered people who have no real knowledge of the Scriptures, knowing only their own wishful thinking and following only conjecture."/>

	<row AyahId="87" Translation="They say, &quot;The Fire is not going to touch us, and [even if it does], it will only be for a few days!&quot; Say [to them], &quot;Have you received a promise from God, for God never breaks His promise, or do you attribute something to God which you do not know?&quot;"/>
	<row AyahId="88" Translation="Truly, those who do evil and are encompassed by their misdeeds, shall be the inmates of the Fire. Therein they shall abide forever,"/>
	<row AyahId="89" Translation="but those who believe and do good works are the heirs of Paradise; there they shall abide forever."/>
	<row AyahId="90" Translation="Remember when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, &quot;Worship none but God and be good to your parents and to relatives and orphans and the needy. And speak kindly to people. Attend to your prayers and pay the zakat [prescribed alms].&quot; But with the exception of a few, you turned away [in aversion] and paid no heed."/>
	<row AyahId="91" Translation="When We made a covenant with you, We said, &quot;You shall not shed each other's blood, nor turn your people out of their homes.&quot; You consented to this and bore witness."/>
	<row AyahId="92" Translation="Yet, here you are, slaying one another and driving some of your own people from their homelands, aiding one another against them, committing sin and aggression; but if they came to you as captives, you would ransom them. Surely their very expulsion was unlawful for you. Do you believe in one part of the Book and deny another part of it? Those of you who act thus shall be rewarded with disgrace in this world and with a severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection. God is never unaware of what you do."/>
	<row AyahId="93" Translation="Such are they who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be helped."/>
	<row AyahId="94" Translation="To Moses We gave the Book and sent a succession of messengers after him. We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.

	<row AyahId="95" Translation="They say, &quot;Our hearts are impenetrably wrapped [against whatever you say],&quot; but God has rejected them for their denial; they have but little faith."/>
	<row AyahId="96" Translation="And now that a Book has come to them from God, fulfilling that [predictions about the final prophet in their scriptures] which is with them, they deny it, whereas previously they used to pray for victory against the disbelievers, yet when there came to them that which they recognized as the truth, they rejected it. God's rejection is the due of all who deny the truth."/>
	<row AyahId="97" Translation="What they have sold their souls for is evil: to the denial of God's own revelation, grudging that He should reveal His bounty to whom He chooses from among His servants! They have incurred wrath upon wrath. Humiliating punishment awaits those who deny the truth."/>
	<row AyahId="98" Translation="When they are told, &quot;Believe in what God has revealed,&quot; they say, &quot;We believe in what was revealed to us,&quot; while they deny the truth in what has been sent down after that, even though it is the Truth, confirming that which they already have. Say, &quot;Why did you kill God's prophets in the past, if you were true believers?"/>
	<row AyahId="99" Translation="Moses came to you with clear signs, but in his absence you worshipped the calf and became wrongdoers.&quot;"/>
	<row AyahId="100" Translation="When We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain above you saying, &quot;Hold firmly to what We have given you and listen,&quot; you said, &quot;We hear, but we disobey,&quot; and their hearts were filled with the love of the calf, because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth. Say, &quot;Evil is that to which your faith enjoins you if you are indeed believers.&quot;"/>
	<row AyahId="101" Translation="Say, &quot;If God's abode of the Hereafter is for you alone, to the exclusion of all others, then wish for death, if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
	<row AyahId="102" Translation="But they will never wish for death, because of what their own hands have sent on before them; God is fully aware of the wrongdoers."/>
	<row AyahId="103" Translation="You will find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even the polytheists. Any of them would wish to be given a life of a thousand years, though even such a long life would not save them from [Our] punishment; and God sees all that they do."/>
	<row AyahId="104" Translation="Say, &quot;Anyone who is an enemy of Gabriel, who by God's leave has brought down to your heart [the Quran] fulfilling that [predictions about the last prophet in the earlier revelations] which precedes it, and is a guidance and good news for the faithful,"/>
	<row AyahId="105" Translation="whoever is an enemy of God, His angels, or His messengers, or of Gabriel or Michael, will surely find that God too is the enemy of those who deny the truth.&quot;"/>
	<row AyahId="106" Translation="We have sent down clear signs to you and no one will reject them except the wicked."/>
	<row AyahId="107" Translation="Why is it that, whenever they make a covenant, some of them cast it aside? Most of them do not believe."/>
	<row AyahId="108" Translation="Whenever a messenger from God has come to them, fulfilling that [predictions] which they already had, some of those to whom the Book was given have cast off the Book of God behind their backs as if they had no knowledge."/>
	<row AyahId="109" Translation="They pursued what the devils falsely attributed to the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon was not an unbeliever: it is the devils who are unbelievers. They taught people witchcraft, and that which was sent down to Harut and Marut, the two angels in Babylon. But these two taught no one until they had said, &quot;We are but a trial, therefore, do not disbelieve [in God's guidance].&quot; So men learnt from them that by which they caused discord between man and wife; but they harmed no one thereby, except by the command of God; [on the contrary], these people learned that which would harm them and do them no good, knowing full well that whoever acquired [this knowledge] would have no share in the Hereafter. Evil indeed was the [price] for which they sold their souls, if only they had known it."/>
	<row AyahId="110" Translation="And had they but believed and been mindful of God, His reward would have been far better for them, if they had but known it."/>
	<row AyahId="111" Translation="Believers, do not say to the Prophet, &quot;Ra'ina&quot; but say, &quot;Unzurna,&quot; and listen to him with attention. For those who deny the truth, there is a painful punishment."/>
	<row AyahId="112" Translation="They who deny the truth from among the People of the Book, or from among those who associate partners with God, do not desire that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But God singles out for His grace whom He wills - for God is limitless in His great bounty."/>
	<row AyahId="113" Translation="If We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We will replace it by a better one or one similar to it. Do you not know that God has power over all things?"/>
	<row AyahId="114" Translation="Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to God alone? And that there is no protector or helper for you besides God?"/>
	<row AyahId="115" Translation="Do you [all] want to question your messenger just as Moses was questioned previously? Anyone who exchanges faith for unbelief has strayed from the right path."/>
	<row AyahId="116" Translation="Many among the People of the Book wish, through envy, to lead you back to unbelief, now that you have embraced the faith and the truth has been made plain to them. But you should pardon them and bear with them until God gives His command. Truly, God has power over all things."/>
	<row AyahId="117" Translation="Attend to your prayers and pay the prescribed alms; any good you store up for yourselves, you will find it with God. Certainly, God sees what you do."/>
	<row AyahId="118" Translation="They declare, &quot;None shall ever enter Heaven unless he be a Jew or a Christian.&quot; This is their own wishful thinking. [Prophet], say, &quot;Produce your evidence if you are telling the truth.&quot;"/>
	<row AyahId="119" Translation="Indeed, those who submit themselves to God and act righteously shall be rewarded by their Lord: they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."/>
	<row AyahId="120" Translation="The Jews say, &quot;The Christians have no ground to stand on,&quot; and the Christians say, &quot;The Jews have no ground to stand on.&quot; Yet they both recite the Book, and those who have no knowledge say the same; God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their disputes."/>
	<row AyahId="121" Translation="Who could be more wicked than someone who prevents God's name from being mentioned in His places of worship, and seeks to bring about their ruin, while it behoves these men to enter them with fear in their hearts?
